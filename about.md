So your a bit curious huh? 

I'm Dan, originally hailing from Australia now residing in Tokyo, Japan. First got my start in the tech industry as frontend developer but moved into InfoSec (Cybersecurity) a few years later, while I did enjoy working on the technical side I was always curious about marketing and business development. 

While working I picked up skill of copywriting and never looked back now I help innovative business owners and companies grow revenue through writing words that sell and prompt clients / customers to action.

To see how I might be able to you grow your business, book in a business growth session below.
